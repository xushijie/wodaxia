This is a sample home page.

## Usage

## 1) Using Github Pages to publish it online

1. Delete the existing `gh-pages` branch from your fork. It will only contain this webpage. You can either use git or [the github web interface](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/#deleting-a-branch)
2. Create a new branch called `gh-pages` (which will then be a copy of master)
3. Head to *yourusername*.github.io/markdown-cv to see your CV live.

Any change you want to make to your CV from then on would have to be done on the `gh-pages` branch and will be immediately rendered by Github Pages.

### Change the style

The included CSS renders CV in different styles:

- `kjhealy` the original default, inspired by [kjhealy's vita
template](https://github.com/kjhealy/kjh-vita)
- `davewhipp` is a tweaked version of `kjhealy`, with bigger fonts and dates
  right aligned

To change the default style, one needs to simply change the variable in the
`_config.yml` file.

Any other styling is possible. More CSS style contributions and forks are welcome!
